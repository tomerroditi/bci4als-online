%% to do list:
% big tasks:
% - create a VAE with the EEGNet structure (need to create custom layers
% for the decoder... this will take alot of work)
% - finish the script for preprocessing hyperparameters optimization
% - figure out how to implement tall arrays for continuous segmentations
%   for when we have too much data to handle at once..

% small tasks:
% - fix the fc activation visualization
% - verify the location of the electrodes in the plot weights function (very important!)
