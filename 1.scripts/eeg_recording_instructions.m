% EEG recording instructures (just some side notes for me)
% - perform some kind of caliberation before starting a recording, meaning
%   check for alpha waves (freq domain), check for spikes after blinking
% - turn off bluetooth devices to prevent noise
% - maybe try to rereference to CZ (might improve the SNR)
