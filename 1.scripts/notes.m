%% to do list:
% - finish big data handling - signal obj
% - create the edf file loader class
% - add a check for unique naming of recorders
% - reject segments obj that has no segments data
% - make an assumption list of the package


%% general notes
% - consider longer time delays (more than 4 seconds) between gestures in the data aquisition
%   protocol with random time difference between gestures - DONE!

% only probabilistic models are suited for this code e.i trees, logistic
% regression, NN etc.. 

% when constructing a feature extraction function, consider dimention 5 as
% trials and dimention 2 as features in the output matrix

%% required toolboxes
% 1. DSP tooblox
% 2. Communications toolbox
% 3. Statistics and Machine Learning toolbox
% 4. Deep Learning toolbox
% 5. Parallel Computing toolbox
% 6. Computer Vision toolbox
